    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>In the past two days I've been working my butt off to set up this blog. It's not my first time to set up a website, but it is my first time to set up a octopress site, and host it on a online <code>Rack PasS</code>, and let it pass through china's <code>GFW</code> (a network filter that blocking foreign websites which china government consider as a threat).</p>

<p>I have also slightly alter the site theme. I like the default theme, so I just made a logo using photoshop and slightly changed the background. The difficult part is modify the <code>SASS</code> to let the page header adjust itâ€™s size automatically, so my blog looks better on smartphones or any other handheld device. Octopress is very well organized, but even still, I had no clue what SASS is, and how to modify it.  After guessing and testing all the SASS code of the default theme I kind of figure out how it works. After a few hours of twisting I finally get it done.<!-- more --></p>

<p>Now, take a look at this beautiful syntax highlitght engine it has:</p>

<p>{% include_code test.js %}</p>

<p>it's one of my wish to have such gorgeous, elegant and user friendly code highlitghter in my blog. I'm in heaven!</p>
