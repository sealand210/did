Planet Earth is a truly beautiful and amazing planet, and Aussies surely know how to protect it.

Here is some shoots taken in the Lake Monger Reserve, it's located 5km north of perth.

It could take a 30 yuan ticket for a visit if China have such a place, but in Australia it's free.

The color of the lake is beautiful, but there is one problem with this picture, the DOF is little bit too short, I must have forgot to adjust the aperture.

It's the first time in my life to spot a black swan, if memory serves me correctly.

Beautiful black body with a red break, black swan surely know how to dress.
