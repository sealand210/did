I like the design of Monster headphones, especially the detachable cable and it's cable design, but I don't appreciate it's sound quality and price tag. My AKG 518dj headphone is the best headphone in it's price range, but it also came with a long, old fashioned and undetachable cable. So I decide to modify it, make it's cable function just like Monsters, and then give it a Monster cable.

The modification is actually very easy. The AKG's headphone is well designed and it's very easy to open up, just remove the pads and there are 3 screws that hold each cup together. Untighten them and the cup will split in half, allowing you to get to the driver connections.

The 3.5mm socket is from a Sony 3.5mm extension cable, it got an aluminum case, which looks very nice.  The gluing and soldering is very basic, but drilling a perfect hole for the socket is quite difficult. The cup is round shaped and 3.5mm socket must come out at a roughly 30 degree angle. It's impossible to precisely measure how much to drill, so I have to slow down the process, and do it very carefully. 

After spending nearly 1 hour to drill the hole using a dremel, and fix the socket with hot glue, I finally got it done.
