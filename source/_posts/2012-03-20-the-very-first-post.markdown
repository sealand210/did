In the past two days I've been working my butt off to set up this blog. It's not my first time to set up a website, but it is my first time to set up a octopress site, and host it on a online `Rack PasS`, and let it pass through china's `GFW` (a network filter that blocking foreign websites which china government consider as a threat).

I have also slightly alter the site theme. I like the default theme, so I just made a logo using photoshop and slightly changed the background. The difficult part is modify the `SASS` to let the page header adjust itâ€™s size automatically, so my blog looks better on smartphones or any other handheld device. Octopress is very well organized, but even still, I had no clue what SASS is, and how to modify it.  After guessing and testing all the SASS code of the default theme I kind of figure out how it works. After a few hours of twisting I finally get it done.<!-- more -->

Now, take a look at this beautiful syntax highlitght engine it has:

{% include_code test.js %}

it's one of my wish to have such gorgeous, elegant and user friendly code highlitghter in my blog. I'm in heaven!
