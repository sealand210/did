  <h1>About the language</h1>
  <p>I am not a native Elgish speaker, I am blogging in English just because it's a wildly used language. Besides, I think it's a good way to practise my english writing, which I am really bad at. So in blog you may find loads of typos and gramma mistakes, but I will do my best to keep them to minimum. </p>
